= Overview

The configuration and code changes that are done to node.js based _Bonjour_ application when deploying on to https://istio.io/[Istio] configured
environment.

NOTE: This application works only on Kubernetes Cluster as OpenShift does not yet support Istio

== Pre-requisites

* https://istio.io/[Istio] is configured and running in your environment
* istioctl binary is available in local path where build will be executed

== What becomes deprecated ?

When deploying with Istio we might not need the explicit tracing related
code to be added in the application business logic, the code just need to propogate
the headers listed below as part of each request.  The Istio will take care of sending the
spans/traces associated with the headers to Zipkin

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the commented code in *tracing.js* (this file might not be need for tracing within Istio) and
*api.js* for changes related to header propagation
====

== What you need ?

=== Tracing

As mentioned in previous sections the following are the headers that needs to be propagated with
each request that needs to be traced:

- x-request-id
- x-b3-traceid
- x-b3-spanid
- x-b3-parentspanid
- x-b3-sampled
- x-b3-flags
- x-ot-span-context

=== Circuit Breakers

_*WIP*_


== Build and Deploy

[code,sh]
----

docker build --rm --tag bonjour:0.0.1 .<1>

cd istio

istioctl kube-inject -f bonjour.yaml -o istio-bonjour.yaml <2>

kubectl -f src/istio/istio-aloha.yaml <3>

----

<1> build the application docker image, if you plan to update the version of the tag, you might also need
to update the same in link:./istio/bonjour.yaml[bonjour.yaml]
<2> the _kube-inject_ i.e. injecting the Istio related init-containers and
sidecars in to the kubernetes deployment yaml found in link:./istio/bonjour.yaml[bonjour.yaml]
<3> Deploying application on to Kubernetes

[NOTE]
====
you can find a istio kube-injected yaml in link:./istio/istio-bonjour.yaml[istio-bonjour.yaml]
